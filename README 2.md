# cvtemplate
A template for academic CV

Includes basic sections that you might want/need for an academic CV. 

Note: Section symbols are my design, but part of me worries that it might be a bit "too cute", so feel free to modify the template as you like. You would need to the "fontawesome" package in order for them to work; otherwise just delete them all and it should compile successfully. If it still doesn't work, feel free to email me and I'll look into it.
